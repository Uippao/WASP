WASP Lite help
=======================

Welcome to the Workspace Access and Storage Portal (WASP)!
WASP is designed to handle .wsp (WASP Workspace File) files, which are configuration files for opening multiple applications, web links, and executing commands.

WASP Lite is a simplified, console-based version of WASP. The full version of WASP will include a graphical user interface and additional features.

Using WASP Lite:
----------------
To use WASP Lite, open a WASP Workspace File and choose to open it with WASP Lite.
You can use WASP Workspaces to open multiple apps, websites, and execute commands with your specified configuration.

Creating .wsp Files:
--------------------
.wsp files are written in YAML format. Below is an explanation of the structure and what is optional or mandatory.
You can create a new WASP Workspace File with default contents into a path of your choice with the app, or make an empty one by right clicking and choosing New -> New WASP Workspace File.

The basic structure of a .wsp file includes three main sections: files, links, and commands.

Files Section:
  - Each file entry can contain the following fields, but the mandatory fields have to be specified:
    - path: (Mandatory) The path to the application executable, or shortcut (a '.lnk' file).
    - args: (Optional) Arguments to pass to the application. Leave out or set to an empty string if not needed.
    - workingDirectory: (Optional) The working directory for the application. If not specified, it defaults to the directory of the application executable.
    - useShellExecute: (Optional) A boolean value indicating whether to use shell execute. Defaults to true if not specified.
    - verb: (Optional) A verb to use when opening the application. Leave out or set to an empty string if not needed.
    - maximized: (Optional) A boolean value indicating whether to start the application maximized. Defaults to false if not specified.
    - delay: (Optional) The delay in milliseconds before starting the application.
    - order: (Mandatory) The order in which to execute this action relative to others.

Links Section:
  - Each link entry can contain the following fields, but the mandatory fields have to be specified:
    - url: (Mandatory) The URL to open.
    - browser: (Optional) The path to the browser executable. If not specified, the default browser is used.
    - windowStyle: (Optional) An integer value representing the window style. Defaults to normal (0) if not specified.
    - delay: (Optional) The delay in milliseconds before opening the link.
    - order: (Mandatory) The order in which to execute this action relative to others.

Commands Section:
  - Each command entry can contain the following fields:
    - type: (Mandatory) The type of command to execute (cmd or powershell).
    - script: (Mandatory) The script or command to execute.
    - runAsAdministrator: (Optional) A boolean value indicating whether to run the command as an administrator. Defaults to false.
    - delay: (Optional) The delay in milliseconds before executing the command.
    - createNoWindow: (Optional) A boolean value indicating whether to create no window for the command execution. Defaults to false.
    - order: (Mandatory) The order in which to execute this action relative to others.

Example .wsp File:
------------------
files:
  - path: "C:\\Path\\To\\Application.exe"
    args: ""
    workingDirectory: "C:\\Path\\To"
    useShellExecute: true
    verb: "open"
    maximized: false
    delay: 1000
    order: 1

links:
  - url: "http://www.example.com"
    browser: "C:\\Path\\To\\Browser.exe"
    windowStyle: 2
    delay: 2000
    order: 2

commands:
  - type: "cmd"
    script: "echo Hello, World!"
    runAsAdministrator: false
    delay: 3000
    createNoWindow: false
    order: 3

  - type: "powershell"
    script: "Get-Process"
    runAsAdministrator: true
    delay: 4000
    createNoWindow: false
    order: 4

Editing .wsp Files:
-------------------
.wsp files can be edited using any text editor. Simply right-click the file, choose 'open with', open with a text editor of choice and edit the file.
After editing, save the file and re-open it with WASP Lite.
It is strongly recommended to check the file contents with a YAML validator after editing for mistakes.

Thank you for using WASP Lite!
